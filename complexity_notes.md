<h3> Selection sort: </h3>
<b>Time:</b> O(n^2)

<h3> Quicksort: </h3>
<b>Time:</b>
- Best case: O(n log n)
- Worse case (list sorted in reverse order): O(n^2)
- Randomized: ~O(n log n)

<h3> Merge sort: </h3>
<b>Time:</b> O(n log n)

<h3> Notes: </h3>
- Quicksort used more often than merge sort because even though merge sort avoids worst case scenario time complexity of quick sort, the sorting operation repeated by merge sort is more expensive than quick sort's sorting mechanism
